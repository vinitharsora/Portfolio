I used multiple html tags and various css properties to give this website a good look. All the css styling code has been written in external css file in css folder. Image folder contains all the images used on the page. Below I am mentioning html tags that I used on this website.

1. header
2. div
3. ul and li
4. a
5. span
6. h1-h6
7. section
8. p
9. img
10. footer
11. form
12. input
13. textarea


CSS
In css I learned and used some new properties. Some of the properties like animation was new for me. I used those properties to create beautiful background for my home section. When we first land on the page, Home section is the first we see. That's why I wanted to make it look minimalistic yet beautiful. Using these animations properties in css I made some blocks which comes from bottom and goes to top in a rotating manner. As they go up, opacity of the blocks reduces from 1 to 0 which make them disappear. This whole animation gives a background a beautiful look. I consider this as one of the best part on the page. Please consider this for extra points. 

On the rest of the page I mostly used flex for arrangement of content. Added media queries for tablet and smartphone size screens. So website retains its rich UI look on any screen size. Image gallery with some hover effects has been added in projects section. I used a different color combination with black and white theme and red as a bonus color which looks great on black. I used different types of css selectors in external css file for styling elements properly. Also I tried to keep css file clean by adding section wise css.  I tried to make UI rich as possible. I have covered all the points given in instructions.
